## What is an HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.**

## How the web works ##

**How the web works provides a simplified view of what happens when you view a webpage in a web browser on your computer or phone.**

**User request and the Service sends them a copy, or a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.**

**Your internet connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the web. It's basically like the street between your house and the shop.**

**TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might get around).**

** DNS: Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place (see below). This is like looking up the address of the shop so you can access it.** 
 
 
 ## What's JavaScript ##
 
 **JavaScript is JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.**
 
 **JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!**
 
 ## What's HTML attribute? ##
 
 **Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.**
 
 - A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.) -
