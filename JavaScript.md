# Whats JavaScript
**JavaScript is programming language, it is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found with HTML codes**
# There are 4 ways to decalare with js variables.
+ Using let
+ Using var
+ Using const
# Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values)
# Variable let
**If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.**
# variable Const
**If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.**
# variable var
**If you working on old pages you can use var.**

## Control Flow

**The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.**

**The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the if and else sections, the lines promptUser and submitForm could also be calls to other functions in the script**

## Java Funtion

**A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).**
